1) A brief description of the project. You can use the Achievement 2 project brief (PDF) or your README file as inspiration. In your description, try also to reflect on your work by answering the following questions (you don't need too much detail; the key points are fine):
- What was your role for this project and what tasks did you face?

- What decisions did you take and why? What were the consequences?

- If you could, what would you do differently?

- What lessons did you learn during this project?


2) A screenshot to represent the project.

4) Live version of the app https://movie-site.herokuapp.com

5) A list of the technologies used for each project (React, CSS etc. â€” again, you can pull this from your README file).

6) Any other relevant materials you created for the project; for example, user flows, user stories, and/or a Kanban board. Be sure to explain how you worked with these materials during the project.
